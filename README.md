# fewd-2020-project

This website is a game that asks you a series of questions. If you answer the questions right, you will advance to the next question. If you answer wrong, the game will end. The responses to these questions will not be stored and the user can play the game as many times as they would like. The senarios are not real senarios and are fictional. 

The requirements used in this website are:

1. Use “:nth-child” or “nth-of-type” to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table. This was used on the leaderboard page. 

2. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the “hamburger” menu item.

3. Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example adding a new row to a table, based on a value passed to the loop. This was used on the leaderboard page. 


4. Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction. This was used on all the question pages. 


HINT:

For a hidden feature type in "Elon Musk" on the leaderboard.
